# Basic 2D Platformer

This is my first try to ever develop a game-like JS with a lot of TODOs in it. It's still in progress so keep in mind it's sometimes unplayable. You just need a basic server running (i.e. a VSCode extension).

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/reference/) - Used JS library.
- [The Coding Train Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) - Awesome resource to learn the basics of p5.js.
